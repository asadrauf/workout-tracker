> ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) #As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

These are the programming languages that we used to built this application
**node.js and mongodb and express**
